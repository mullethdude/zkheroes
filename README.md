Sadly no working code to be shared :(

## Zero Knowledge Rogue-like
### A game like Rogue
  Turn-based explorer game

  ### Zero knowledge used to prove the completion of the game without telling how it was done, so nobody else can do it.
   Game working on starknet
## Challenges
Lack of a verifier on starknet we almost thought to port the verifier on goerli from solidity to cairo

It is not possible to run cairo and the proover in a web browser environment without the use of trusted server --> not compatible with dapp

no time to implement a working POC â€“ :(

we learn a lot about making starknet Dapp, and the power of standalone cairo

## What's Next

lot's of idea for zk nfts for the game

implementation of a POC on starknet with a server based cairo proover

happy to help for the creation of a wasm version of cairo
